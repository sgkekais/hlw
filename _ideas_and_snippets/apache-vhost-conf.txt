Which address were you using?

I had the same problem today.

I was accessing it using the url http://localhost/lumen.api/public/ and I think that was the cause of the error.

To get around it, this is what I did:

First I configured a new VirtualHost entry on Xampp, located in "C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf" in my case:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/lumen.api/public"
    ServerName lumen.api
    ServerAlias www.lumen.api
    ErrorLog "logs/lumen.api-error.log"
    CustomLog "logs/lumen.api-access.log" common
    <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/lumen.api/public">
        AllowOverride All
        Require all Granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

and restarted Apache on Xampp.

Then I edited my hosts file (c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts) to map a new address to my localhost.

# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#   127.0.0.1       localhost
#   ::1             localhost   
    127.0.0.1       lumen.api

I tried again using the new URL http://lumen.api and the error was gone.
